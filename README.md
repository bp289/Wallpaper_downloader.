# Wallpaper downloader
This is a wallpaper downloader script which allows you to automatically download images from wallhaven.cc, and cycle through those downloaded images on your desktop.
You can also choose to cycle through images you already have in pc if you choose to. As of now it is only a command line application which works on windows 32 bit
and 64 bit. Future updates will bring a GUI and versions for linux and mac, as well as additional options to use images specific to the current screen resolutions.
